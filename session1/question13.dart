//What will be the output of this code snippet? Explain your answer: ```dart void main() { int x = 5; int y = x + 2 * 3; print(y); } ```

// the solution:

/* In Dart, as in most programming languages, multiplication (*) has a higher precedence than addition (+).
So, 2 * 3 is calculated first, which results in 6.
Then, the result of 2 * 3 (which is 6) is added to x (which is 5), so the final value of y is 5 + 6 = 11.
*/

// output => 11
